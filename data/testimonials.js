    text: 'Here I was, 4 years ago with a 12 years old forum ruined by VBulletin 5, and then hacked. I cannot imagine worse conditions to start with. Ivan of Todo10 did everything to look so easy, we got rid of the hacker then migrated the broken VB5 forum to Xenforo. Since then they are around the clock for us solving every request I have. 24/7 of great professional service, by far the best I\'ve ever seen or heard of. They are simply incredible! Everything you read in other testimonials is true. Highly recommended!',
